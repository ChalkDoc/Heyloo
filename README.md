# Heyloo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.0. It was created by Kory Skarbek and Melvin Gruschow for Steve Walker as part of our internship from Epicods.  This application was designed to run parallel and integrate with the ChalkDoc website, taking in math assignment plans and turning it into a game similar to that of the quiz game Kahoot.  

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Go into the environment files and set the credentials to match with your own firebase account.  Dont forget to add this file to the gitignore to maintain security.  

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
